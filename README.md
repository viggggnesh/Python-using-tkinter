# Inventory Management Application

### PYTHON 3.X IS REQUIRED TO RUN THIS PROGRAM ###
### .db FILE CAN BE OPENED EXTERNALLY USING SQLITE3 DATABASE SOFTWARE ###

A Python GUI project using the `tkinter` module.

It's my first project, so not very thorough with the finer details. It's fairly beginner stuff. Working as a local database.

Data is stored in a `.db` file, and stored data can be searched across fields.
